Hello, FAR AI folks!

I wanted to put out feelers about the [Engineering Manager](https://far.ai/post/2023-12-engineering-manager/) role. The deadline is today and I'm a couple of weeks shy of shifting into job-search mode (currently in-batch at Recurse), so I hope it's not unwelcome to gauge potential interest in the absence of a full application.

## Interest

I've been watching the AI and existential risk space from the sidelines for nearly a decade. Recently, I worked through [ARENA](https://arena.education) with the aim of working on technical aspects of alignment and mechanistic interpretability. 

Preaching to the choir a bit: the importance of AI safety, alignment, and interpretability work cannot be overstated. How that work evolves is likely to shape the future - and this role description prompted me to consider contributing not only technically, but in terms of strategy, developing collaborations, project- and team-building. 

All of my relevant experience is in research organizations and startups: please see my roles at Oxford, UBC/MDRU, Kardium, and UMich/BUL on [my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/monicaspisar).

A quick pass over the About You section of the job posting:

## About you

### Leading and managing technical projects/teams

Referenced above.

### Software engineering foundation/experience

Academic research (~10 years): programmed in C and MATLAB: signal capture and processing; medical image processing; device modeling; parallel computing; statistical image reconstruction 

Startup: Medical device research engineer (~2 years): MATLAB + finite element modeling: device physics and materials simulations. 

Small, nimble software org: Software engineer (~2 years): Led the design and implementation of an updated streaming data pipeline, from instrumention to data transport and processing, to data warehousing and analytics. This work involved close collaboration with infrastructure and networking teams as well as the grants team. Subsequently joined the infrastructure team.

I've worked in Python and Go, and am now learning Rust.

### Results-oriented, motivated by impactful research

  - materials completed through to mechanistic interpretability; currently completing reinforcement learning and model evaluation chapters
  - PyTorch, Jax, Einops

### Operating system internals and distributed systems
- Basic knowledge, keen to learn more

### Math!
- linear algebra, calculus, vector probability, and statistics courses covered during physics BS and engineering PhD
- have recently reviewed all of these topics working through ARENA

### Publications
- [Research overview and resulting publications](https://monicaspisar.com/publications/)

## Wrap up!

Thanks so much for reading through, I'd be keen to hear if my background and skills might be what you're seeking for this role.
